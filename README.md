Conclusion
JMS (Java Message Service) is an API that provides the facility to create, send and read messages. It provides loosely coupled, reliable and asynchronous communication. JMS is also known as a messaging service.
GlassFish is the reference implementation of Java EE and as such supports Enterprise JavaBeans, JPA, JavaServer Faces, JMS, RMI, JavaServer Pages, servlets, etc.  
GlassFish Server uses the Message Queue software as its native JMS provider, providing transparent JMS messaging support. This support is known within GlassFish Server as the JMS Service. 
JMS requires only minimal administration. When a JMS client accesses a JMS administered object for the first time, the client JVM retrieves the JMS configuration from GlassFish Server
JMS provides messaging service that is loosely coupled, reliable and can be synchronous or asynchronous communication
